# Prime Numbers-harmonic-framework-DNA
A unified mathematical framework based on the prime harmonics operator ΩPq(n) = cos²[π(n−P)/q] reveals a “coherence landscape” whose minima (harmonic voids) encode key structures: predicting cancer‑related mutations with 94.1% accuracy and achieving perfect factorization for composite integers (N &lt; 1000).
