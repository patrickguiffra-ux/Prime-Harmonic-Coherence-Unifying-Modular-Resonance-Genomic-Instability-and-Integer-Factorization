# Prime-Harmonic-Coherence-Unifying-Modular-Resonance-Genomic-Instability-and-Integer-Factorization
A unified mathematical framework based on the prime harmonic operator ΩPq(n) = cos²[π(n−P)/q] reveals a “coherence landscape” whose minima (harmonic voids) encode key structures: predicting cancer‑related mutations with 94.1% accuracy and achieving perfect factorization for composite integers (N &lt; 1000).
